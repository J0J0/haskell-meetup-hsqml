Shows some further QML basics like:
- defining additional object properties,
- referring to an object by `id`,
- including arbitrary JavaScript code in appropriate places like the `onTriggered` handler of a timer.

You can use the the utility program `qmlscene` (included in the
*qt-declarative* submodule of Qt5) to run this example:

    qmlscene ex2.qml

(Alternatively, you could adapt the files from ex1 and make an executable ...)
