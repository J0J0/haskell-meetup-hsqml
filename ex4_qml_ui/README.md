Here we see how we can build classical user interfaces with
QML/QtQuick using the "Qt Quick Controls" module. In addition,
we can see modularized QML code in action: Simply place a file
`Xyz.qml` into the same directory (or any other searched path)
and instantiate `Xyz` objects in your main file. (Here, `Xyz`
is `CountTimer`.)

Run this example via:

    qmlscene ex4.qml
